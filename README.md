# Hotel Manegment 

A Java program to manage hotel booking.

## Requirements
This is a Hotel Management tool which can be used to manage activates like storing customer details, ordering food for particular rooms, unbooking rooms and showing the bill. It can also be used to see different room features and room availability. It is a menu driven program and it runs until the user exits. File handling has been used to store the current status of the hotel(customer details, booked rooms, food ordered) in a file once the program exits so that when we restart the program, the old details are not lost. The System checks the guest dept and the money he paid.
